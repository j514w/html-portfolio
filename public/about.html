<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Joey Wee Jie Yee from Malaysia. My birthday is on 14th of May. I'm graduated from Curtin University, and I am majoring in Marketing and Management.
  I have a background in business during my highschool and also degree. However, I have always wanted to learn web development 
  as I found out it is cool to develop a website through coding. Therefore, I come acreoss to find out a Web development course
  on Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu.</p>

<p>During my free time, I like to do some home workout and also go for rock climbing. Besides, I play golf as well. However, it is
  not that frequent compare to the other two. When it comes to pet, I am a dog person.
